## TockyConvNet (TockyCNN)

The **TockyML** Python package (**TockyConvNetPy**) is a part of [the **TockyMachineLearnig** toolkit](https://monotockylab.github.io/TockyMachineLearning/) and provides machine learning methods for analysing flow cytometric data from Fluorescent Timer reporters. 

Specifically, the current package **TockyConvNetPy** provides:

- ConvNet modelling and analysis using image-converted flow cytometric Tocky data generated by the R package [**TockyConvNetR**](https://monotockylab.github.io/TockyConvNetR/)
- GradCAM Analysis

The **TockyConvNet** Approach is achieved by the integrated workflow through the use of **TockyConvNetR** and **TockyConvNetPy**.

- **TockyConvNetR**: An R package focused on data preprocessing and feature cell analysis suitable for Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) analyses. This package facilitates image conversion methods for preparing Tocky data and implements Inverse GradCAM Gating Analysis to interpret ConvNet/Grad-CAM outputs.

- **TockyConvNetPy**: A Python package dedicated to performing ConvNet training and conducting Grad-CAM analysis, complementing the R-based preprocessing and analysis tools.
