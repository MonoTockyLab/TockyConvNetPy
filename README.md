The **TockyML** Python package (**TockyConvNetPy**) is a part of the **TockyMachineLearnig** toolkit and provides machine learning methods for analysing flow cytometric data from Fluorescent Timer reporters. 

Specifically, the package provides:

- **TockyCNN**: ConvNet modelling and analysis using image-converted flow cytometric Tocky data generated by **TockyML_R**
- GradCAM Analysis


The scehametic figure below provides an overview on the workflows within TockyMachineLearning.

## Installation
To install TockyMLPy, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
## Installation
### From GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/MonoTockyLab/TockyConvNetPy.git
```

## Requirements
TockyMLPy requires the following packages:

- tensorflow=2.10.0
- keras=2.10.0
- numpy>=1.21.0,<1.22.0
- scikit-learn>=1.1.2,<1.2.0
- matplotlib>=3.5.3,<3.6.0
- scipy>=1.10.1,<1.11.0
- scikit-image>=0.19.2,<0.20.0
- pandas>=1.5.3,<1.6.0

## Example Notebook

Explore our [TockyCNN-GradCAM Heatmap Analysis Notebook](examples/TockyMLPy_GradCAM_visualization.html) for detailed examples on how to use TockyCNN and visualize and interpret model decisions using a GradCAM approach. 

To explore the example notebook provided with TockyMLPy, you will need to have JupyterLab installed on your machine. If you do not have JupyterLab installed, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

Once JupyterLab is installed, follow these steps to open the example notebook:

1. **Download and Extract the TockyMLPy Repository**:
   If you have not already, download the repository from GitHub and extract it to a convenient location on your computer.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**:
   Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).

3. **Navigate to the Examples Directory**:
   Use the `cd` command to change directories to the `examples/` folder inside the TockyMLPy repository. If you have extracted the repository to, for example, `C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\TockyMLPy`, enter:

   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\TockyMLPy\examples
   ```

   Or if on a Unix-based system like macOS or Linux, it might look like:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/TockyMLPy/examples
   ```

4. **Start JupyterLab**:
   Run JupyterLab by entering the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
This command will start the JupyterLab server and usually opens JupyterLab in your default web browser automatically. If it doesn't open automatically, the terminal will display a URL that you can copy and paste into your browser to access JupyterLab manually.

5. **Open the Notebook**:
   Once JupyterLab opens in your browser, navigate through the file browser within JupyterLab to locate and open the `TockyMLPy_GradCAM_visualization.ipynb` notebook.
